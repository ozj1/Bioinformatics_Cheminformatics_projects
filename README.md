First project: predicting toxicity and solubility of molecules  
include:  
       Deepcharm module and toxicity dataset  
       Model trained for toxicity using tox21_datasets and MultitaskClassifier  
       Model shows over-fitting as the test dataset scores are much less compared to the train-set. But model can predict toxicity of the testset molecules  
       Graph convolutional neural network model is trained on solubility dataset (delaney dataset from MoleculeNet)  
       Solubility values were predicted for new molecules, and we showed their structure using RDKit. Extra queries for substructures in sample molecules are also shown        here.
